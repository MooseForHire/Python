Variables

In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. 
That data could be the location of a plane, or the time of day, or the television show youâ€™re currently watching. 
The only important thing is that it may be different at different times. 
Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.
